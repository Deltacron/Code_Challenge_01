# Code Challenge 01

Your task is to write a simple Fan page.

# Apis: https://swapi.dev
Click on the Documentation in the upper right corner. In the documentation, please find the panel with Resources on the left side and utilize that to create the application.


# Steps
Write a React app that utilizes API from the above URL
<ol>
    <li>Use redux / context API for state management and Axios (or similar library) for fetching data from APIs.</li>
    <li>Utilize the APIs and create a Home page with at least three categories using the 'Resources' panel from the above website. </li>
    <li>When a user clicks on a category, it will navigate to another page with a list of subitems in that category.</li>
    <li>Display spinner or placeholder component while the API request is ongoing.</li>
    <li>Make it look decent and responsive so that it doesnâ€™t look terrible on a mobile phone. Add images for each device.</li>
    <li>Push the code to a public GitHub repo with a README.md that explains how to execute the app.</li>
</ol>

# BONUS
* Frequent and thoughtful commits.
* Dockerize the app.
* Write realistic unit/end-to-end tests.
